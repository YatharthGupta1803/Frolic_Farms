# 🌾 Frolic Farms & Banquets – Full Stack Web Project

A modern, responsive website for "Frolic Farms & Banquets" designed to showcase venue details and capture potential customer leads through a contact form. This project is built entirely by me from scratch based on a Figma design and serves as my **CS50 Final Project** and **freelancing portfolio** starter.
